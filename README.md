## Election-Audit Summary
This script can be used in a variety of ways for future elections.  With slight modifications that script can be leveraged to provide data from city elections all the way up to federal elections.  Replacing the county with either city, state or federal input would allow for this flexibility.  Furthermore, the addition of incremental logic can also allow the script to provide candidate results by city, county, region, state, etc.  As the voter data expands, to provide gender and other demographics, this could be added to the script as well.
